    content: `# The Secret Behind All Great Copywriting

Good copy isn't written, it's assembled. It's the careful curation of words that have been proven to work, arranged in a way that feels fresh but familiar.

## The Foundation

The best copywriters know that effective copy is built on three pillars:

1. **Clarity** - Your message must be immediately understood
2. **Relevance** - It must matter to your audience
3. **Action** - It must compel people to do something

## The Process

Great copy doesn't start with writing—it starts with listening. The most persuasive words come directly from your customers' mouths. Here's how to find them:

- Study customer reviews
- Analyze support tickets
- Read forum discussions
- Conduct user interviews

## The Framework

Every piece of compelling copy follows this simple framework:

1. Problem
2. Agitation
3. Solution

### Example

Bad: "Our software helps you manage tasks better."
Good: "Stop losing track of deadlines. Our software turns chaos into clarity."

## Conclusion

Remember: The goal isn't to be clever—it's to be clear. Write like you talk, edit like you're ruthless.`
