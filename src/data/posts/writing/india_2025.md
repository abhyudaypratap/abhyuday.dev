# Creating Intuitive Products That Users Just Get

## Introduction

Building intuitive products is more science than art. It's about understanding human psychology and applying proven design principles.

## Core Principles

1. **Familiarity** - Use patterns users already know
2. **Consistency** - Keep interactions predictable
3. **Feedback** - Always show system status
4. **Forgiveness** - Make errors reversible

## The Process

1. User Research
2. Prototyping
3. Testing
4. Iteration

## Best Practices

- Start with user needs
- Remove friction
- Test with real users
- Iterate based on feedback

## Conclusion

The best products feel obvious in hindsight. They don't make users thinkâ€”they just work.
