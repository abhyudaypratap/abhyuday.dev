# My thoughts about India 2025

## The debate
I see the daily debate in my inner circle and full on fight on social media people putting two completely different perspective.
1. India is super bad and it going to dark side
2. India is fastest growing economy and will be among top countries in near future.

## My thougths

Both sides are correct with their perspectives.
India is developing nation and needs lot of consistent work for next few decades to be in similar paradim as developed nations currently like Germany, USA, Sweden.
India is a poor country that's the first hard truth Indians need to accept.

Simple comparision if you want to do is from car ownership
Here are some numbers below as of 2025

| Country | Car Ownership Percentage |
|---------|--------------------------|
| USA     | 91% [1]                 |
| Germany | 89% [2]                 |
| China   | 37% [3]                 |
| India   | 8% [4]                  |
