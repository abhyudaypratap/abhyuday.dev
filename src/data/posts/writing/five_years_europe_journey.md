# Five years in Europe

## Berlin

City with a wall(Mauer). Amazing city and fact which I love to quote the city with **more than 2,500 public parks.[1]** City where you can be whatever you want to be.
From vibrant day to crazy night scene.

## Exploring Beyond

Living in Europe has made it possible to explore neighboring countries with ease. Some memorable experiences include:

- Exploring Iceland
- Skiing in Czechia
- Hiking in Black Forest
